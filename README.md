# BeShines

Shines is an innovative SocialFi project built on the TON blockchain and integrated with a Telegram bot. Leveraging the latest AI generation technology, Shines allows users to select video templates, upload their own photos, and see themselves transformed in fun and imaginative ways. Users can share their unique videos and enjoy watching creations from friends and others in the community. Shines not only offers daily entertainment but also helps users enhance their presence among friends and build influence. By regularly uploading photos and generated videos, users can create memorable experiences and increase their attractiveness within the community. The platform also incorporates a point system, rewarding users for sharing their content, thus creating entertainment and engagement around the Telegram bot and TON ecosystem. Hope to bring mass adoption to telegram and TON.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
